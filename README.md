<strong> A-Record Exercise </strong><br>
  <em>Basically, log into Client-1 <br>
    ping "mainframe" <br>
    nslookup "mainframe" <br>
    (Both are going to fail because there is no DNS record) <br>
    So, log into DC-1 with your domain admin account (mydomain.com\jane_admin) and create a DNS A-record for "mainframe" <br>
    Have the DNS A-record point to DC-1‚Äôs Private IP address <br>
    Log back into Client-1 and ping "mainframe" again. It should work this time. <br></em>
<strong>Simplified Version:</strong><br>
<strong>Log into DC-1 </strong><br>
<strong>Create a DNS A-record for "mainframe"</strong><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   - Server Manager > <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   - Tools (near top, to the right of the flag > <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   - DNS > <br>
<img width="959" alt="Capture - Tools + DNS" src="https://github.com/jaysixco/creating-dns-record/assets/160427311/c60fa30d-a54a-45f6-8830-1f6f7f2e1f3b">
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   - Click "DC-1" in the sidebar > <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   - Click "Forward Looking Zone" in the sidebar > <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   - Click "mydomain.com" in the sidebar > <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   - Right click the white space > <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   - Click New Host (A) > <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   - Type mainframe > <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   - Type whatever IP address you want (ex: cmd > ipconfig > private IP address) ><br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   - Click Add Host (don't have to click any of the checkboxes above) > <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   - Click Done <br>
<strong> Log into Client-1 </strong><br>
<strong> Type "cmd" in search bar > then ping "mainframe" (without quotation marks) </strong><br>


<strong> Local DNS Cache Exercise </strong><br>
<em> What is going on here? <br>
Basically, if you change the mainframe's record address, when you ping it, it will still show the old record address until you flush the DNS cache. <br>
<strong>To see for yourself: </strong>
</em> <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; - Log in to DC-1 and change mainframe‚Äôs record address to 8.8.8.8 <br>
DC-1 > Forward looking zone > mydomain.com > Right click mainframe > Properties > Type 8.8.8.8 in IP address box > Click Apply > Click Ok
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; - Go back to Client-1 and ping ‚Äúmainframe‚Äù again. Observe that it still pings the old address (you'll recieve replies from the old IP address) <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; - Observe the local dns cache (ipconfig /displaydns). It will show that A (Host) Record is still the old address. <br>
<strong>How to flush the DNS cache </strong><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; - Switch back to DC-1. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; - Flush the DNS cache (run cmd as an administrator) **(ipconfig /flushdns)**. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; - Ping ‚Äúmainframe‚Äù again . The new record address should show up <br>
<br>

<br>
<strong> CNAME Record Exercise </strong><br>
<em> What is going on here? <br></em>
Go back to DC-1 and create a CNAME record that points the host ‚Äúsearch‚Äù to ‚Äúwww.google.com‚Äù <br>
<strong>To create a CNAME record</strong><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; - DNS manager ><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; - Right click + select New Alias (literally says CNAME) ><br>
<img width="565" alt="Capture - New Alias (CName)" src="https://github.com/jaysixco/creating-dns-record/assets/160427311/46d6ecb9-e0b7-47cb-904f-9c2801ac33d1">
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; - Literally type search in first box and www.google.com in second box (literally sooooooo easy üò©) ><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; - Do I need to check box? Nope > <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; - Click ok <br>
<img width="300" alt="Capture - search + google" src="https://github.com/jaysixco/creating-dns-record/assets/160427311/77628443-22e4-4616-a93e-ec581dc1230c">
<br>
<strong> Switch to Client-1 </strong><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; - Ping ‚Äúsearch‚Äù <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; - Nslookup ‚Äúsearch‚Äù <br>
<strong>If you did everything correctly you should see</strong><br>
<img width="354" alt="Capture - ping + nslookup" src="https://github.com/jaysixco/creating-dns-record/assets/160427311/3e623d41-fa39-45d4-8f65-87ec24e9a23e">
<br>
<strong>NOTE:</strong> if above steps don't work, try flushing the cache first (ipconfig /flushdns) and then ping again. <br>
<br>
<strong> Finish </strong>
